Files in this folder:

 * data-anomalies has code and some intermediate outputs related to detecting and classifying reporting anomalies
 * figures has code used for making figures in the manuscript and supplement
 * scores has code used for scoring forecasts

Some of the code for scoring forecasts and making figures relies on retrospective ensemble fits and forecast files. These are available in [this zip file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18TjrgZR1HwOr7xRIN7PW7-4CVXz3hYQm/). To run that code, you will have to download it an unzip it into the `code` folder, creating new folders `code/retrospective-forecasts`, `code/retrospective-fits`, and `code/retrospective-weights`.
